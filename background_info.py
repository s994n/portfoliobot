I’m a mid-level engineer who loves working across full technology stacks in collaboration with others, as well
as developing great tests, contributing to clean architecture and playing both leading and supporting roles in
project teams.
My first taste of programming was during my DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford. There, I designed and
programmed instruments that helped to uncover the chemistry and physics of bird navigation. Following this,
as an editor for a portfolio of scientific journals, I experienced the power of technology to improve products,
which inspired me to return to programming.
Having completed a Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, and gained experience as a Site
Reliability Engineer at Dunelm, I joined Whitelabel Collaborative, a venture studio specialising in custom
application and website builds.
I’m now looking for a new challenge, and to apply my skills for problem-solving and passion for software
development in an environment that encourages learning and creative, curious thinking.
